This is project was focused in searching weather for particular cities around the wordl.
Build by php for the backend and html, css and js for the frontend I focused more in tailwind css though
I got the API key from https://openweathermap.org/api and also for dynamic image generation for cities I
used https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/
